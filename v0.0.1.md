Discover the UNIX Philosophy
With BASH, node.js, and Tessel.

Not a programming book
Systems thinking book
Goal is to give the reader a deep appreciation of the power of the UNIX philosophy. And why it's hilariously spawned from Multics.

Seven Big Parts and a Preface:
Preface
  This book is not a programming book - those fade away
    BASH and JavaScript are ugly and powerful

  Regular Expressions and file globbing
  `whoami` vs $(whoami)

  ssh
Bash scripting makes you a wizard
  Composing the simple commands lets you do anything you want to

    embraces the internet better than bash possibly can - important
    npm and module ecosystem
      churn and semver
    super fast iteration cycles
    The nodejs website is useless for beginners, but that's OK bc its great for hackers
  node.js hello world server
  Notes on the internet networking stack, communications protocols
  More commands that are applicable to nodejs environments
  starting a nodeserver at initialization time with upstart
Tessel
  UNIX philosophy as a hardware development system
    modular hardware
    embraces the internet
    utilizes node.js and command line
    runs UNIX
  Tessel Hello World
    No idea what the coolest thing that's easy is
  A note on abstractions, managing async control flow is hard, observables
  Thinking about data flow (finally have multiple devices)
    Sensor data in, >> file, less +F file from another window bc you can
    Move tessel to ethernet or wi-fi, same thing via websockets
    Connect website to server, server to tessel, use tessel as input and output
